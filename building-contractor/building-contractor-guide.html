        <h2 class="intro-title">For New House Construction User:</h2>
        <h1>Building Contractor Guide: Unlock the Secrets to Selecting the Right Contractor, Creating Effective
            Contracts, and Saving Money in Your House Construction for <a href="#pricing-plans">Only ₹199</a></h1>


        <p>Are you planning to start your own house construction soon? Then this is something for you…</p>

        <p>Did you know that in house construction, one of the most important steps is choosing the right Contractor?
        </p>


        <p>Building/labour contractors are some of the most important ones, and you should choose them carefully. </p>

        <p>He is the only contractor you will be dealing with from start to end of your house construction. Sometimes,
            you need them even after your construction to fix some issues here and there.</p>

        <p>If you choose the wrong person, you will suffer a lot financially and mentally.</p>

        <p>I learned some lessons after building two houses with two builders and two different types of contract
            agreements.</p>

        <p>I will share everything I know and learned in my Building Contractor Guide after constructing <b><u>two
                    houses.</u></b></p>

        <p>This guide includes everything first-time home builders need to know about picking, evaluating,
            structuring deals, common construction mistakes, etc., and all the information I shared inside this guide.
        </p>

        <p>This guide contains 45+ pages of content to cover all the details with relevant images for better
            understanding. </p>

        <p>These are all easy-to-understand guides; you can cover all these in one sitting. But I recommend first going
            through roughly once… second time, sit and try to grasp all the points slowly so that you understand
            properly what it is.</p>

        <p><i><b>Never underestimate the importance of choosing the right building contractor.</i></b></p>

        <p>I have seen and heard many horror stories about Building contractors leaving or creating problems during
            construction.</p>

        <p>What will you do in such cases?</p>

        <p>Suppose any issues happen with the contractor during the construction work. In that case, it's not easy to
            choose another contractor because none of them show interest in starting a problematic project.</p>

        <p>Not just that. </p>

        <p>All contractors start the project with full energy… but they don't have the same energy to complete your
            construction work once they start. </p>

        <p>Why? </p>

        <p>Because now the project is confirmed. Even if a delay happens, you cannot easily change the contractor. </p>

        <p>That's the reason.</p>

        <p>Why do some projects get delayed while others finish as planned? </p>

        <p>It could be due to the building contractor's role as well. </p>

        <p>In this guide, I'm going to share all the important points that all new users need to know.</p>

        <h2>I have personally seen…</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Contractor creating a dispute at the ending stage of the construction (with my dad's friend's house
                behind our house).</li>
            <li>Contractor not reachable during the housewarming function (they need even after the function) (near our
                house, one uncle informed).</li>
            <li>The contractor stopped working in the middle of construction (at another dad's friend's house & at our
                plumber's house).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>…and many such disputes I have personally seen and heard. </p>

        <p>They all happen because the house owner makes mistakes when choosing the right contractor. </p>

        <p>If you want to avoid such issues yourself, here is a guide. Written by someone who has gone through
            construction experience twice.</p>

        <h2>This guide is not just about choosing the right Building Contractor…</h2>

        <p>It's also about framing Good Contract Terms.</p>

        <p>Just choosing the right building contractor is not enough. </p>

        <p> You have to properly frame the agreement so that you don't get into any dispute with your contractor.</p>

        <p>If yours is the first time and relied on your contractor for the agreement, then you are doing wrong. </p>

        <p>Because the contractor brings an agreement that is favorable to him instead of you.</p>

        <p>How can we prevent such a thing? </p>

        <p>Easy. Even if the contractor brings agreements, mention the points I shared in Contract Tips, and you will be
            safe.</p>

        <p>These are the few areas where disputes with building contractors usually happen.</p>

        <h2>Building Construction Tips and Lessons</h2>

        <p>I also shared some of the common mistakes many new owners make while constructing their houses unknowingly.
        </p>

        <p>These are the lessons that I learned after making such mistakes in our house by spending our own money on it.
        </p>

        <p>Avoiding these mistakes while constructing your house can save you thousands of rupees. You cannot even fix
            some mistakes if you must do so later once the construction ends.</p>

        <p>If you know all such mistakes at the construction stage, you can avoid making them all…</p>

        <p>65+ such construction mistakes/tips are shared in this guide. </p>

        <p>You will save a lot even if you use any two of them.</p>
